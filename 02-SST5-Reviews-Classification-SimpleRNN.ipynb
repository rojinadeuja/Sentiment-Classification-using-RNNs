    "The first naive approach to this dataset gives us a test accuracy of 59.9%. Part of the problem is that our inputs only consider the first 500 words, rather than full sequences—hence, the RNN has access to less information than the earlier baseline model. The remainder of the problem is that SimpleRNN isn’t good at processing long sequences, such as text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better, which we explore in the next notebooks."
